Chest X-ray Classification with CNN and TensorFlow

This repository contains a project that automates chest X-ray image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) implemented with TensorFlow. The project's key features include:
- Implementation of a customized CNN architecture optimized for chest X-ray classification.
- Training and optimization of the CNN model on diverse chest X-ray datasets to enhance accuracy and performance.
- Development of a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) for uploading and classifying chest X-ray images.

The methodology involves data collection from Kaggle, model development using TensorFlow, and preprocessing of the dataset to ensure robust model training.

This project was conducted as part of university coursework, demonstrating the application of machine learning in medical image analysis with a focus on usability and accuracy.
